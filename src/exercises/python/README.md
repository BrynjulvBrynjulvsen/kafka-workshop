# Python

Currently, we have only implemented a subset of the workshop in Python.
In other words, the suggested solutions may not be available in Python as of now. 
In any case, please go ahead and solve the workshop in Python should you prefer to use Python over Kotlin.


## Installation

With Python 3 installed:
```
python3 -m venv <MY_VENVS_PATH>/kafka_workshop 
<MY_VENVS_PATH>/kafka_workshop/bin/activate 
pip3 install kafka-python
```
