    // Create your own Avro-schema and associated topic, add a consumer to listen to the topic, and then
    //  produce a message using the schema to serialise it, and verify that the message was sent by checking that
    //  your listener did indeed consume the message.
    //  Try scaling horizontally. Are all your consumers receiving messages? If not, think about the configuration of
    //  your topic. What might prevent all consumers from receiving messages?
